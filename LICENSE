----------------------------------------------------------------------------

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution–NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License (“Public
License”).

Section 1 – Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
   Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and
   in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged,
   transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission
   under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For
   purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a
   musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
   always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed
   relation with a moving image.

b. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
   closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
   performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
   Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.

c. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
   absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
   fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty
   adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
   agreements.

d. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any
   other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that
   applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

e. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or
   other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

f. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms
   and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all
   Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
   Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

g. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
   under this Public License.

h. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
   process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as
   reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
   dissemination, communication, or importation.

   under this Public License.

Section 2 – Scope.

a. License grant.
   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
      Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
      non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise
      the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
      A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part;
      and
      B. produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material.

b. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
   Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License
   does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and
   conditions.

c. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

d. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
   authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
   formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make
   technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/
   or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from
   making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed
   Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
   Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public
   License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
   does not produce Adapted Material.

e. Downstream recipients.
   1. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
      the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
      Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
      conditions of this Public License.
   2. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
      additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
      Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if
      doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any
      recipient of the Licensed Material.

f. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
   construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
   Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
   endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
   designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A).
